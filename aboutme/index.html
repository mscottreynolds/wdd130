    <h2>M. Scott Reynolds</h2>
    <h2>Scott</h2>
    <p>Hello.  My name is Scott.  I was born in Apple Valley, California, but grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.  
        When I was married I lived in both Utah and Arizona.  I now have been living in Herriman, Utah for 
        the last 7 years.
    </p>
    <p>I just finished PathwayConnect and this is my first semester at BYU-Idaho.  My goal is to get a bachelors 
        degree in Applied Technology.
    </p>
    <p>A few years ago, I became disabled and now suffer from severe chronic-pain. While my life has completely 
        changed because of the chronic pain and the associated trials, in a way it has been a blessing because 
        it has brought me so much closer to God, my Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ.  Heavenly Father 
        is a God of miracles!  He loves me (and you), and has been with me this whole time.  I love Him and 
        would not have survived without Him.  While I still suffer from the trials of chronic pain, I am excited 
        and look forward to a new life that has started with BYU-Pathway Worldwide.
