                <p>Do you like to study the history of <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org" target="_blank">The
                        Church of Jesus
                        Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>? Do you like to
                    study language or alternate alphabets? Did you know that Brigham Young, second president of the
                    church, proposed an alternate alphabet for the English language? It was called The
                    Deseret Alphabet and it is a hobby of mine. This website is a place where you can learn more
                    about this fascinating aspect of church history. You can learn why this alternate alphabet was
                    created and what happened to it, see pictures of books that were printed in it, and even

                <p> As more and more individuals become interested in the Deseret Alphabet, they will publish their work
                    on the internet. This site is also meant to be a reseource for finding these other useful sites that
                    contain information that is considered to be of worth to fans of the Deseret Alphabet. This site
                    aims
                    to make it easier to find resources, without having to weed through the many sites that will show up
                    on a
                    search engine, due to the general wording of Alphabet. The word Deseret however, is rather unique
                    and can sometimes be used as an easy way to find more information. The links to other resources on
                    this site are periodically checked and keep updated, as sites come and go. If you have a resource
                    related
                    to the Deseret Alphabet that you feel would be of worth to other fans and would like a link to it
                    from
                    this site, just send me a message.

                    The general public is also being introduced to the Deseret Alphabet as various sites publish
                    articles on this “oddity” and strange part of “Mormon” history. Because of this more and more people
                    are beginning to look up the Deseret Alphabet to find more information about it, and possibly learn
                    to read and write in it themselves. This site aims to provide enough information for those users as
                    a portal, or launching pad, for finding other resources about the Deseret Alphabet. Included on this
                    site are scanned images of the first two Readers of the Deseret Alphabet, and part of the third book
                    that was printed. Also included on this site are instructions on learning to read and write in the
                    Deseret Alphabet that was created by other people that are skilled in language and writing who
                    happen to also find the Deseret Alphabet interesting.
