                    Other individuals who are fans of the Deseret Alphabet have even gone so far as to create new fonts
                    for the Deseret Alphabet. Some of those fonts can be found on this site. Also, because of these same
                    individuals, the Deseret Alphabet font is probably already in your computer, via Unicode! Every
                    modern Mac or PC that has Unicode can see the Deseret Alphabet. Samples of the Deseret Alphabet in
                    the Unicode font are also on this site.

                    And for reading material, fans of the Deseret Alphabet have started to convert public domain stories
                    and books into the Deseret Alphabet and are making them available as printed books. You can even buy
                    them off of Amazon.com. This includes some of the tales of Sherlock Holmes, Biography of Benjamin
                    Franklin, and even the Constitution of the United States.

                    Over recent years, fans of the Deseret Alphabet have been collecting together various files that
                    relate to the Deseret Alphabet, like pictures of old newspaper articles, poems and short stories
                    that have been written, examples of art using the Deseret Alphabet, including much more. There are
                    files on this site that can assist the new, or even experienced, fans of the Deseret Alphabet that
                    are available for download. There are documents that contain scans of the complete Book of Mormon
                    that you can download yourself allowing you to read and have access to that and the other books that
                    were originally printed in the Deseret Alphabet. A book that goes into depth on learning to read and
                    write in the Deseret Alphabet is also available for download.
