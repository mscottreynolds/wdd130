    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Do you like church history? Do you like to study language or alternate alphabets? Did you know that Brigham Young
      proposed an alternate alphabet for the English language? He sure did! It was called The Deseret Alphabet and it is
      a hobby of mine. I have a website where you can learn more about this fascinating aspect of church history. You
      can learn why this alternate alphabet was created and what happened to it, see pictures of books that were printed
      in it, and even learn to read and write in it yourself. You can even download and read a scanned copy of the
      entire Book of Mormon that was printed in the Deseret Alphabet.</p> <!-- change this -->

      The main purpose of the Deseret Alphabet Portal site is to introduce people to the Deseret Alphabet and give them
      enough resources so they can learn more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As more and more individuals become interested in the Deseret Alphabet, they will publish their work on the
      internet. This site aims to provide links to these sites that are considered to be of worth to other fans of the
      Deseret Alphabet, thus making it easier to find resources, without having to weed through the many sites that will
      show up on a search engine, due to the general wording of Alphabet. The word Deseret however, is rather unique and
      can sometimes be an easy way to find more information. The links to other resources on this site are periodically
      checked and keep updated, as sites come and go.
      <p>
        This site, the Deseret Alphabet Portal, along with the domain DeseretAlphabet.org, aims to be a long lasting and
        reliable source for information on the Deseret Alphabet for many years to come.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The Deseret Alphabet was created at the direction of Brigham Young as a means of helping immigrants to Utah to
        be able to learn the English language easier. Several books were printed in the Deseret Alphabet, two Readers,
        the first part of the Book of Mormon, and the entire Book of Mormon. Newspaper articles were occasionally
        printed in the Deseret Alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alphabet didn’t gain wide acceptance and fell out of use when Brigham Young died. Since then, it has
        remained relatively unknown until recently. With the creation of the World Wide Web on the internet, curiosity
        about the Deseret Alphabet rose and is becoming more and more popular among hobbyist as a novel way of writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general public is also being introduced to the Deseret Alphabet as various sites publish articles on this
        “oddity” and strange part of “Mormon” history. Because of this more and more people are beginning to look up the
        Deseret Alphabet to find more information about it, and possibly learn to read and write in it themselves. This
        site aims to provide enough information for those users as a portal, or launching pad, for finding other
        resources about the Deseret Alphabet. Included on this site are scanned images of the first two Readers of the
        Deseret Alphabet, and part of the third book that was printed. Also included on this site are instructions on
        learning to read and write in the Deseret Alphabet that was created by other people that are skilled in language
        and writing who happen to also find the Deseret Alphabet interesting.

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>Other individuals who are fans of the Deseret Alphabet have even gone so far as to create new fonts for the
        Deseret Alphabet. Some of those fonts can be found on this site. Also, because of these same individuals, the
        Deseret Alphabet font is probably already in your computer, via Unicode! Every modern Mac or PC that has Unicode
        can see the Deseret Alphabet. Samples of the Deseret Alphabet in the Unicode font are also on this site.</p>
      <p>And for reading material, fans of the Deseret Alphabet have started to convert public domain stories and books
        into the Deseret Alphabet and are making them available as printed books. You can even buy them off of
        Amazon.com. This includes some of the tales of Sherlock Holmes, Biography of Benjamin Franklin, and even the
        Constitution of the United States.</p>
      <p>Over recent years, fans of the Deseret Alphabet have been collecting together various files that relate to the
        Deseret Alphabet, like pictures of old newspaper articles, poems and short stories that have been written,
        examples of art using the Deseret Alphabet, including much more. There are files on this site that can assist
        the new, or even experienced, fans of the Deseret Alphabet that are available for download. There are documents
        that contain scans of the complete Book of Mormon that you can download yourself allowing you to read and have
        access to that and the other books that were originally printed in the Deseret Alphabet. A book that goes into
        depth on learning to read and write in the Deseret Alphabet is also available for download.</p>
