    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Do you like church history? Do you like to study language or alternate alphabets? Did you know that Brigham Young
      proposed an alternate alphabet for the English language? He sure did! It was called The Deseret Alphabet and it is
      a hobby of mine. I have a website where you can learn more about this fascinating aspect of church history. You
      can learn why this alternate alphabet was created and what happened to it, see pictures of books that were printed
      in it, and even learn to read and write in it yourself. You can even download and read a scanned copy of the
      entire Book of Mormon that was printed in the Deseret Alphabet.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This site is for hobbiest of the Deseret Alphabet, those who want to learn to read and write using the Deseret Alphabet,
      those who are currious about it's history, or just anyone that is wants to know what is that funny writting
      that is frequently attributed to "the Mormons". This site is also meant as a reseource for learning more about the Deseret Alphabet
      and finding other useful sites that contain information related to the Deseret Alphabet.
